description: "Understand how the Mio SDK stitches together OAuth, token storage, and LLM capabilities so you can launch user-facing AI features quickly."
---

<Info>
  Mio exposes three SDK surfaces: a **browser client** that drives OAuth, a **server SDK** that secures tokens, and **React helpers** that talk to the LLM. Keep this page open while you prototype so you always know where each responsibility lives.
</Info>

## Build secure AI workflows faster

Mio packages the entire authentication loop (OAuth → token exchange → LLM call) so you can stay focused on product work. You configure the SDK once per surface, then re-use the same helpers in every route, component, or server action that needs user data.

    Use `MioClientSDK` plus `MioProvider` and `useMio` to start the OAuth flow, capture the callback, and invoke Mio's chat + summary endpoints directly from Next.js or any React tree.

    Configure `MioServerSDK` once at process start, exchange codes securely, refresh tokens, and inject verified `accessToken` values into your data layer or queues.

## What you ship with Mio

- **Consistent OAuth flow** – redirect users with `connect()`, read the callback, and keep URLs clean.
- **Battle-tested token exchange** – hide `clientSecret` on the server, refresh on schedule, and reuse the same helper everywhere.
- **LLM primitives** – call `chat` and `getUserSummary` with automatic schema validation and helpful error messages.

<Tip>
  Prototype with the hosted defaults (`dashboard.mio.xyz`, `auth.mio.xyz`, `llm.mio.xyz`) and only override URLs when you move to a private environment.

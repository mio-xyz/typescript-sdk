## What is Mio?

Mio is a context layer for AI apps. It gives developers access to user preferences, letting them build truly personal experiences.

For the user, it’s a simple sign in with Google at onboarding.

For developers, it’s a tool call.

<Info>
  Mio spans three surfaces: a browser client that drives OAuth, a server runtime that secures tokens, and React helpers that plug Mio Context into your UI.
</Info>

## How the integration works

1. **Connect**: start OAuth from your client experience and redirect users to the Mio dashboard.
2. **Exchange**: hand the authorization code to your backend so it can store `refreshToken` securely and mint fresh access tokens.
3. **Get Mio Context**: send `getContext` or `getContextSummary` requests with a valid `accessToken` to retrieve rich, ready-to-use context you can feed into any assistant, email, or workflow.

<Tip>
  Prototype with the hosted defaults (`dashboard.mio.xyz`, `auth.mio.xyz`, `llm.mio.xyz`) and only override URLs when you move to a private environment.

## Quickstart

[Get Started with Mio in &lt;10 mins](/quickstart).

### Why Mio?

- **Simple integration**: add Mio to your app, chatbot, agent to make it personal in &gt;10 mins.
- **Context seeding**: Mio derives preferences from existing datasource during onboarding. With Mio, users get answers from an assistant that already knows them from the first time they use your app.
- **Focus on your product**: instead of spending months building your own context engine and integrating datasources, plug in Mio to make your AI app personal today.
